### Backwardcompatibility from doil 1.1

Due to technical restictions we can't provide a backwardcompatibility for
the handling of the addresses within instances created by doil. Though it
is still possibile to use instances created with older versions of doil
by editing the `docker-compose.yml` in your project root folder:

Add following lines to the network section of the service:

```
- doil_proxy
- default
```

so that it looks like this:

```
version: "3.5"
services:
  $instance:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: doil/$instance:stable
    container_name: $instance
    hostname: $instance
    domainname: local
    volumes:
      [...]
    environment:
      [...]
    networks:
      - main_saltnet
      - doil_proxy
      - default
```

At the end of the file add following lines to the network section

```
doil_proxy:
  external: true
```

so that it lookes like this:

```
networks:
  doil_proxy:
    external: true
  main_saltnet:
    external: true
```

After `doil up` your instance will be available at `http://doil/$instance`
