# doil - Create ILIAS Development Environments with Docker and ILIAS

**doil** provides you with a simple way to create and manage development and
testing environments for ILIAS. It will create and provision a docker container
according to your requirements, pull the ILIAS version you want to use and even
install it if possible.

## Installation

1. download and unpack the [latest release](https://github.com/conceptsandtraining/doil/releases)
1. execute `sudo ./install.sh` in order to install **doil**
1. you can remove the downloaded folder afterwards
1. check `doil help` for available commands and further instructions

## Update

If you alread installed **doil** you can easily update with following steps:

1. download and unpack the [latest release](https://github.com/conceptsandtraining/doil/releases)
1. execute `sudo ./update.sh` in order to update **doil**
1. you can remove the downloaded folder afterwards

## Dependencies

**doil** tries to use as little 3rd party software on the host system as possible.
However **doil** needs [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in order to work:

* docker version >= 19.03
* docker-compose version >= 1.25.0
* zip

## Usage

### Quick Start

After you installed doil the basic system is ready to go. To get an instance of
ILIAS running you simply need to do following steps:

1. Head to a folder where you want to store your project. Usually `~/Projects`
1. Enter following command: `doil create -n ilias -gr ilias -b release_7 -p 7.4`

Don't worry, this will take a while. It creates and instance of ILIAS named `ilias`
in your location from the repository `ilias` (see `doil repo:list`) with the known
branch `release_7` and the PHP version `7.4`.

After this job is finished you can start your instance with `doil up ilias` and head
to `http://doil/ilias/` to see your fresh ILIAS installation.

### Help

Each command for doil comes with its own help. If you struggle to use a command,
just add `-h` or `--help` to display the according help page. For example:
`doil instances:create --help`. Use `doil --help` if you have no idea where too
start.

### Instances

An *instance* is one environment for and installation of ILIAS. The purpose of
**doil** is to make the management of these instances as simple as possible.
The following commands are available:

* `doil create` (alias for `doil instances:create`) creates a new instance in
  the current working directory
* `doil up` starts an instance that you have created before
* `doil cd` switches the current working directoryto the location of the instance
* `doil ls` lists all available instances
* `doil login` logs you into the container running the instance
* `doil down` stops an instance to free the ressources it needs
* `doil rm` deletes an instance you do not need anymore
* `doil apply` applys a certain state to the instance
* `doil ps` lists the current running doil instances

See `doil instances --help` for more information

### Repository

**doil** can use different ILIAS repositories to create instances. Per default,
the [repository of the ILIAS society](https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS)
will be used to pull the ILIAS code. If you want to use another repository to get
the ILIAS code, you can use commands from `doil repo` to add and manage these
other repositories:

* `doil repo:add` will add a repository to the configuration
* `doil repo:update` will download the repo to **doil**'s local cache or update
  it if it is already downloaded
* `doil instances:create --repo REPO_NAME` will use the repo to create a new
   instance
* `doil repo:delete` - removes a repository
* `doil repo:list` - lists currently registered repositories

See `doil repo --help` for more information

### Global User Support

If you are running `doil` on a system with multiple users you can manage your
repositories and instances globally for all user. For that we implemented several
helper and flags.

#### Adding user to doil

The user who installed doil on the machine is already registered at doil. To add
another user simply use `doil system:user add <username>`. You can manage the users
with following commands:

* `doil system:user add <username>` adds a user
* `doil system:user delete <username>` deletes a user
* `doil system:user list` lists the available users

#### The `--global` flag

Most commands in doil come with a `--global` flag. For instance if you created an
ILIAS instance with `doil create --global` the instance will then be available to
all registered users. You can start the instance with `doil up <instance> --global`.

If you want to create an instance with a global repository you have to use the flag
`-gr|--global-repo`, e.g, `doil create -gr ilias`

Following commands come with the `--global` flag:

**`doil instances`**
* `doil instances:create`
* `doil instances:up`
* `doil instances:down`
* `doil instances:delete`
* `doil instances:apply`
* `doil instances:cd`
* `doil instances:login`

**`doil repo`**
* `doil repo:add`
* `doil repo:delete`
* `doil repo:update`

**doil pack**
* `doil pack:import`
* `doil pack:export`

You can also create global instances with private repositories and vice versa.

### Pack

**doil** lets you transfer the data of one installation of ILIAS ot another. Instances
build with doil (instances from version >=1.1) are able to be exported.

* `doil pack:export` exports an instance
* `doil pack:import` imports an instance

See `doil pack --help` for more information

### Quietmode and Logs

Most of the commands come with a `--quiet` flag to omit the log messages.
However these logs are not lost, they are stored in `/var/log/doil.log`. You may
want to add a rotation to this logfile.

## Known Restrictions

* **doil** was developed and tested on debian and ubuntu systems. It might run
  on other linux based platforms but there is no guarantee

### doil on MacOS

* due to network restrictions on MacOS **doil** can only operate run one instance
  at once. Though it's possible to create as many environments as you want

### doil on Windiws

* **doil** works on Windows with the WSL enabled. Due to network restrictions you
  need to change the host to `localhost` via the doil proxy settings:
  `doil system:proxy host localhost`

## Known Problems

### 404 after doil up

Sometimes it is possible that the proxy server doesn't accept the configuration. This results
in a 404 when heading to your instance after using `doil up`. To fix this you just need to restart
the proxy server with `doil system:proxy restart`. If the 404 still occurs restart your instance
with `doil down` and `doil up`.

### The key not ready loop

While creating an instance or using `doil apply` it is possible that there will be a "Key not ready"
loop. This loop tries to find a certain key in the salt main server. To fix this issue let the loop
run and open a new terminal and do following steps:

* `doil system:salt prune`
* `doil system:salt restart`
* `doil down ${instance}`
* `doil up ${instance}`

Usually the loop will then resolve itself and the creation or apply process will continue. If the loop
continues then there might be a problem with the public key of the salt main server. To fix this do
following steps:

* `doil login ${instance}`
* `rm /var/lib/salt/pki/minion/minion_master.pub`
* `exit`
* `doil down ${instance}`
* `doil up ${instance}`

## Background, Troubleshooting and Development

**doil** uses [SaltStack](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/) to provision and maintain
the instances. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is only used as a light weight
and widely available VM-like technology to run sufficiently isolated linux
environments. SaltStack uses an architecture where one master acts as a central
control server. **doil** runs this master in a dedicated container. The instances
then are deployed into separate containers as minions that are controlled and
provisioned by the master. Required folders are mounted in the users filesystem
via Dockers volumes and can be accessed from the host system.

### System

**doil** comes with some helpers which are usefull if you want to hack on **doil**:

* `doil system:deinstall` will be remove doil from your system
* `doil system:version` displays the version
* `doil system:help` displays the main help page

See `doil system --help` for more information

### SaltStack

To be able to dive deeper into the inner workings of **doil** or customize it
to fit your workflow or requirements, **doil** provides commands to tamper with
the saltstack in the background. These commands will not be required by ordinary
users, so make sure to understand what you are doing.

* `doil system:salt login` logs the user into the main salt server
* `doil system:salt prune` prunes the main salt server
* `doil system:salt start` starts the salt main server
* `doil system:salt stop` stops the salt main server
* `doil system:salt restart` restarts the salt main server
* `doil system:salt states` to list the available states

See `doil system:salt --help` for more information

### Proxy Server

To be able to dive deeper into the inner workings of **doil** or customize it
to fit your workflow or requirements, **doil** provides commands to tamper with
the proxy in the background. These commands will not be required by ordinary
users, so make sure to understand what you are doing.

* `doil system:proxy login` logs the user into the proxy server
* `doil system:proxy prune` removes the configuration of the proxy server
* `doil system:proxy start` starts the proxy server
* `doil system:proxy stop` stops the proxy server
* `doil system:proxy restart` restarts the proxy server
* `doil system:proxy reload` reloads the configuration
* `doil system:proxy host <host>` changes the default host

See `doil system:proxy --help` for more information
